ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my GitHub projects page. I'm Sajjad, a dedicated Computer Engineering student at Eskisehir Osmangazi University. Currently on the journey to complete my Bachelor's degree, I have a keen interest in data engineering and crafting data-driven applications using machine learning.

For the next few months, my focus will be on intensive studies in image processing and computer vision. This short-term endeavor aims to equip me with the skills necessary for upcoming auto-detection projects. Join me on this coding adventure as I explore the dynamic intersections of technology and innovation!
